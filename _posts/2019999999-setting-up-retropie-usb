I've had various setups of RetroPie over the years, and one thing that always seems to happen is corruption of the SD card when you overclock the raspberry pi. 

This is a tutorial of how to setup RetroPie, using the SD only to hand off to a USB flash drive, which will be used as the main drive for RetroPie.


Download the latest pre-made image for your version of raspberry pi: 
[https://retropie.org.uk/download/](https://retropie.org.uk/download/)

Extract the image
```
gunzip retropie-4.4-rpi2_rpi3.img.gz
```

Check what path has been assigned for your usb device by using the command
```
lsblk
```
In my case, it is sdb

Write the image to your usd device
```
sudo dd bs=4M if=retropie-4.4-rpi2_rpi3.img of=/dev/sdb
```

This will now create 2 partitions, the boot partition and the main.

We need to copy the boot partition files over to the sdcard.

First start by setting up the memory card

```
fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

press d, and delete all partitions
then press n, and create a new partition 
make sure it is primary and bootable.
```

Onces its all setup, mount the usb and sd card

```
mkdir /media/usbdrive-boot
mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usbdrive-boot

mkdir /media/sdcard-boot
mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdcard-boot
```

Then copy all the files from the usb boot partition, over to the sd card

```
cp -r * /media/usbdrive-boot/ /media/sdcard-boot/
```

Then change the pointer in the cmdline.txt file, to say where the main partition is kept.




You now won't be able to resize the partition using raspi-config, but you should still be able to do this using the command line

```
fdisk /dev/sda
```

```
print partitions
delete second partion
create new partition and start at same block as previously
make sure its primary and linux
reboot
```
