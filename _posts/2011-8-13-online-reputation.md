So I've been reading a lot recently about "Online Reputation" and how important it is going to be in the future, Apparently its common now for employers to do a "Google Search" and have a look at what you have achieved in online communities. I think this is a positive, I mean I do like to go onto sites like StackOverflow and help people out with programming related problems, its just the negatives...

What's to stop someone posting something bad about you online? I mean everyone has a past and we all have the odd photo on Facebook we don't want potential employers to see! The thought is a little bit scary!!
