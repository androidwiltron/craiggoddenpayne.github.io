I found this blog post probably one of the most difficult I have ever had to write, which is why it 
has taken me so long to, there are as few points in here that I've tried my best to be as sensitive 
and professional as possible, but I feel I had to talk about it, because well, someone has to...


Me and a couple of guys from the office entered HackManchester (me for the third year running). 
We also gained an additional member of the team, Jon was looking to join a team.

We got to MOSI at around about 12, found a good table and awaited the challenges.

One of the things I noticed this year, was a lack of prizes compared to previous years. Did not put
us off though, we wanted to go for best company or the GCHQ challenge, it would be great to win two 
years in a row!!


We took the brief and dismantled it.

`To celebrate GCHQ opening a new office in Manchester, we wanted to challenge Hack Manchester participants to think locally. There are lots of fantastic open data sources available about Greater Manchester â€“ we want to see how you can utilise this data to improve the safety of the general public.`


The main things we aimed to do were

- Test ourselves with tech that will stretch us
- Build something to Improve Safety of public
- Use Open Data Sources as mentioned in the brief
- Have fun, and make something that is serious, yet not too much so


The idea we came up was 
- A native Android app, GraphQL, DotNetCore WebApi, AWS, React.js, ElasticSearch, TwitterApi, Google Maps Api
- Which plots the safest route from A to B, helping to keep the user safe
- By checking open data sets (Police Stop and Search data, TFGM traffic data, Ufo Sightings, Ghost Sightings) and live real time data by scrapping twitter fot certain keywords
- With the fun element being a dark mode, which flipped the idea, allowing the user to participate in crime.

What we ended up building was this:

We felt like we had targeted the brief well, and that we had a good chance at winning!

An hour before we were due to attend the awards ceremony, we saw a message on the HackManchester channel, 
saying that we had been disqualified due to not submitting a video.

Above is the message we got (which has since been deleted from slack, I guess because its such a massive
mess up, they don't want people to know publicly what happened)


As you can imagine, after 25 hours (yes we didn't sleep, and put our best into this idea) you can sense the frustration.
I didn't want to go to the awards ceremony, but was conviced to at least have a word with the judges to
find out what is happening.

I did speak with the judge, and they failed to convince me that we were not disqualified.



After the judging, it annoyed me a bit that we saw judges during the day, but they were not even
at the awards ceremony, and our category seemed to be overlooked compared to the rest.


The winner of our category, I can honestly say I did not see the code, or understand the challenges they
faced, but it seemed so far off brief that it made no sense that they won. The other runner up in our
category I would say was on par in terms of brief, choice of tech, and would have been a worthy winner 
if selected.

I feel like we were not the only team who deserved something more than they got, it felt very much
like the theme this year was year of the women in tech. Don't get me wrong, I whole heartedly support
women in tech, its a great inititive, but it feels by lowering the bar / promoting it in this way
goes against what you are trying to achieve in the first place, all it creates is something people 
cannot aspire to, surely equality is what people want, and I feel this year the decision for best in
show was a very clear nod to a worthy inititive, but at the expense of the time and effort the majority
of teams put in to enter what should have been an equal playing field competition.

I know it probably makes me look like a sore loser, but honestly, it took a lot for me to speak out
about this, something I put a lot of time and effort in and was very passionate about, and it made me 
feel like the competition is just a PR stunt, and not a breeding ground for innovation, a place to meet
likeminded developers, and something to have a laugh and build something crazy for 25 hours.

If you are entering next year, you should ask the judging panel to make their data open, even if its 
finding out how many votes each team went. We were messed about on many levels, and because of this I
feel like I won't support hack manchester, even though it's something I'm very passionate about.
