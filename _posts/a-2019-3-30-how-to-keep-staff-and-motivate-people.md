### Micromanagement is a complete waste of everybody's time. It sucjs the life out of employees, fosters anxiety and creates a high stress work environment. Select the right people and give them room to get on with the job. - Brigette Hyacinth.

Yes, people are resources, but they do not need to be treated as resources.

### Are statements like this true?

- We do not pay employees to be happy, we pay them to do work. 
- To be effective, you have to closely monitor their activities. 

### What I've witnessed.

I have seen that when you let your staff have freedom to express their opinions, work towards a common goal instead of being told what to do, choosing the right tools for the job rather than being told which tech to use, you allow those people to evolve. 

People stop doing the minimum work they can get away with to keep a manager happy, and suddenly want to do what is best for the business, become more productive and innovative. 

## My experience 

I've recently had a very strange experience where management style seems to have reverted back to how it was a few years ago. A new CTO was appointed, and wanted to change things up. 

#### What we had before was:

- A problem was identified and we worked out the best and most effecient way to fix the problem.
- The ability to select the best technology to fix this problem, because you know we've been doing this a long time and have experience
- A very tight knit team, with the businesses best interest at heart
- A high performing group of very skilled engineers
- An agile process which we had defined and tailored to make us efficient
- A CI platform where we could deploy many times per day to production

#### What happened?

The new CTO joined, did not understand the technology because he was inexperienced in those areas and decided to test all the staff (as in actual code tests) where he would mark and give feedback as to what level he thought we were as developers, as he believed that we should all have to prove our worth. He labeled us all junior developers.

As a principle software engineer, naturally I declined the test, but did end up doing the test just to prove a point. This was after a lot of time explaining design decisions, explaining the architectual decisions, only to be told that we should be using things like topshelf? when we are using technology that is much more advanced.

#### What we are left with is:

- Problems are solutionised by a single individual (who knows best) and as a developer we just need to write a solution
- A predifined set of technology, identified by a single person. This includes changes to source control system, moving to EC2 from ECS, using JIRA only and using PHP instead of C#
- A team of people who dislike their leader, more stress and anxiety
- A daily scrum call with the whole department, lasting between 30-60 minutes a day
- A fortnightly release


What has happened is in less than 6 weeks, 6 (out of 9) members of the tech department, had left or handed their notice in. Due to moving house and having a baby, I was one of the last the leave!

All work has been handed over to a development agency, and it seems like they went for a "cheap" option, as a lot of the development agency seem very inexperienced. The project manager unable to understand how to prioritise, assigning tickets that were estimated at 14 days (which obviously should have been broken down) put into a 2 week sprint.

Before the CTO we sat down with the head of engineering, and worked out the best ways to work, we cam up with guidelines on how we would allow each other to grow, psychological safety and very collaborative, efficient work using the right technology. All decisions were made by council, no one was treated more senior than anyone else, we were all equal. 

What is left now is all decisions are made by a single person, who seems way out of his depth, and is in grave danger of destabilizing the system, and people feel inferior within themselves, and have no space to grow their skills, only to build what they are paid to do, nothing else.
