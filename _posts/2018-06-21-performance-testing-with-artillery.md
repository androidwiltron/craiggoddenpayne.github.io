title: Performance Testing an Api using Artillery and Faker

I needed to do some performance testing on a lambda, behind an api gateway to just prove that it scaled well, and my initial thought was to turn to something I've used before, such as Gatling, JMeter or Siege. I decided to try out artillery.io, and was very impressed!!

### Artillery

According to their site:

Artillery is a modern, powerful & easy-to-use load testing toolkit. Use it to ship scalable applications that stay performant & resilient under high load

Its a library, in node, which is extremely easy to setup and use. The documentation isn't the best in terms of examples, but I managed to soldier on.

What I was testing was an api, which I needed to post a block of json. Since I wanted the payload to be dynamic (each payload needed to have a different email address), I used Faker, which is another node library which will generate random, but realistic style data for a variety of data fields such as emails, phone numbers, addresses, dates, colours images etc. It seems to be able to do pretty much anything!

### Setup

First you need to install faker and artillery from npm

```
npm i artillery faker
```

Then you will need to create your artillery config file.
Here is the one I used:


- fullapplication-test.yml

```
config:
  target: "https://url-changed.com"
  processor: "./random-fullapplication-payload.js"
  phases:    
    - duration: 120
      arrivalRate: 5
scenarios:
  - name: "FullApplication Requests"
    flow:
      - function: "generateRandomPayload"
      - post:
          url: "/fullapplication"
          json: "{{payload}}"                   
```

This sends, for 2 minutes, 5 requests per second to https://url-changed.com/fullapplication using a post and the payload that I generate in the function "generateRandomPayload".

- random-fullapplication-payload.js

```
'use strict';
var Faker = require('faker');
module.exports = {
  generateRandomPayload
};

function generateRandomPayload(userContext, events, done) {    
  var payload = {
    "Data":"hasbeenremoved",
    "Email":"email"
  };

  payload.Email =  Faker.internet.exampleEmail();  
  userContext.vars.payload = payload;  
  return done();
}
```

When the function is called, the payload is generated based on my template, and I swap out the email, based on the value generated from Faker.

### Runnning and reporting

To run the test, and generate the report i ran the following command

```
artillery run -o report.json fullapplication-test.yaml
artillery report report.json
```

The html outputted report contains a really good breakdown of how the test performed.
I was pretty impressed to get so much out of it, for only an hour or so's work!!
