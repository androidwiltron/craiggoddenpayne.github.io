I've been reading a lot lately about JSONP and cross domain scripting and the massive pain it causes when doing things like page scraping.

I created my own PageScraper JQuery Plugin, which utilises Yahoo Query Language to scrape websites and return the html, without having to make JSON calls to the website (and enable JSONP etc.)


This way I can call any site and get back the result.


You can use it as follows:

```js
$().scrapePage("http://www.google.com", function (data) {
    document.write(JSON.stringify(data));
});
```

You can check out the code on my GibHub:
